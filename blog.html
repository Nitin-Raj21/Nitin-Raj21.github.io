                <p class="blog-post_text">
                    The BMW M 1000 RR is the superbike homologated for racing. It was perfected in the wind tunnel and further developed on the circuit.
                    It has optimised aerodynamics and uses carbon, resulting in a significantly higher top speed of 314 km/h.
                    Its engine and chassis remain as powerful and direct as ever.

                <p class="blog-post_text">
                    This is it: the lightest and most powerful production crossover bike in the world. Nothing less. An M bike through and through.
                    Trimmed down for maximum performance – in this case, long-distance performance. That's why it's called the M XR. Or, as we like to call it: MaXimizeR.
